There are two types of vaiables in php.
1.scalar	(contains only one value at a time).
2.Array		(contains a list of values or even another array).



Scope of variables:

In PHP, variables can be declared anywhere in the script.

The scope of a variable is the part of the script where the variable can be referenced/used.

PHP has three different variable scopes:

local
global
static


Global Scope:



A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function.



Local Scope:



A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function.


PHP The global Keyword:


The global keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function.
To do this, use the global keyword before the variables (inside the function)


PHP also stores all global variables in an array called $GLOBALS[index]. The index holds the name of the variable. 
This array is also accessible from within functions and can be used to update global variables directly.


PHP The static Keyword:

Normally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a 
local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job.
To do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable:
