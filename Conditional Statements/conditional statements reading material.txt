			PHP CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

	In php we have the following conditional statements

	if statement
	if-else statement
	if-else if-else statement
	switch statement


	if Statement:
syntax
	if(condition)
	{


	code executed if condition is true


	}



	if-else Statement:

syntax 

	if(condition)
	{


	code executed if condition is true


	}

	else

	{

	code executed if condition is flase

	}
	 

	if-else if-else Statement:

syntax 

	if(condition)
	{


	code executed if condition is true


	}


	else if(condition)
	{


	code executed if condition is true


	}

	
	else

	{

	code executed if condition is flase

	}
	 
	

	Php  switch Statement:
	
	use switch statement select one of the many blocks of code to be executed



syntax


	switch(n)
	{

	case label1:

	code to be executed if n= label 1;
	break;


	case label2:

	code to be executed if n= label 2;
	break;


	default:

	code to be executed if n is different from both label 1 and label2;
	break;



	}


		The Main difference b/w if-else  and switch statement is that we can not use relational operator in switch statement.
