Php supports the following data types

	string
	float
	integer
	boolean
	array
	object
	null
	resource


	PHP String:

	
	A string is a sequence of characters, like "Hello world!".
	A string can be any text inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:


	PHP Integer:

	An integer is a whole number (without decimals).  It is a number between -2,147,483,648 and +2,147,483,647.


	PHP Float:


	A float (floating point number) is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.
	In the following example $x is a float.


	PHP Boolean:

	A Boolean represents two possible states: TRUE or FALSE.

	PHP Array:

	An array stores multiple values in one single variable.
	In the following example $cars is an array.



	PHP Object:

	An object is a data type which stores data and information on how to process that data.
	In PHP, an object must be explicitly declared.
	First we must declare a class of object. For this, we use the class keyword. 
	A class is a structure that can contain properties and methods


	PHP NULL Value:

	Null is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.
	A variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it.
	If a variable is created without a value, it is automatically assigned a value of NULL.
	Variables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL

	PHP Resource:

	The special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a reference to functions 
	and resources external to PHP.
	A common example of using the resource data type is a database call.



	Php has a number of function to test data type of a variables some of are as follows:

	var_dump();
	is_numeric();
	is_int();
	is_float();
	is_bool();
	is_string();
	is_array();
	is_object();
	is_resorce();
	is_null();


	All these function takes one arguments and return a value.
