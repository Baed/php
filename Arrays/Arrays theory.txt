	What is an array?


	An array stores multiple values on single variable or we can say that

			An array is a special variable which can hold more than one values at a time.


In php there are three types of arrays

1.Indexed Array: Arrays with numeric Index.

2.Associative Array:Arrays with named keys.

3.Multidimensional Array:Arrays contianing one or more arrays.







		Indexed/Numeric Arrays


	A numeric array stores each element with a numeric Id key.

	The index can be assigned automatically(index always starts at o).


		Associative Arrays

	when storing data about specific named values, a numerical array is not always best ay to do it
	with associative arrays each element referenced by a string index, typically a numeric index
	is called an index and a string index is called a key.


	Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.when storing data
	about specific named values.	



		Multidimensional Arrays


	In a multidimensional array each element in the main array can also be an array.
	And each element in the sub-array can be an array and so on.
